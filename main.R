  #Description
    #"The trade elasticity is the reaction of bilateral import flows (in value) to a change in the applied import tariff for a given product (as defined by the WCOâ€™s six-digit Harmonized System classification in revision 2007 - hereafter HS6)."
    #Trade elasticities for semiconductors are very large in magnitude
